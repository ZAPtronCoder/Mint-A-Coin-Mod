Have the coins be throwable as weapons, you could make them do different damage or different effects based on what the coins are idc I just think it'd be interesting tf they were throwable

For the customizeable currency you could just rip the code from a banner and a loom and use it in the same way

Make the coins able to be placed and pile up terraria style

Have wells that could give you an effect when you threw a coin in there

Have a coin that has a 50/50 chance of killing you upon flippage, probably made out of 9 other different coins, you could use it as a way to gamble your own life

the flipping system being a simple system where the player could sneak right click with a coin in their hand to hypothetically flip it.

An ATM where you could deposit currency and get it back from other places, like an ender chest for money from this mod

have a shit coin that has no value and can only be thrown. It'd generate randomly on the forest floors and could be a toggleable feature for people who don't want an effective shit post

Coin bags that act like hammers as melee weapons. They'd deal large damage but have slow recharge time

Mint Coin Encyclopedia, in game book that dynamically changes based on what coins you have found before (could also be called the Numismatist's guide to MI-CO)
