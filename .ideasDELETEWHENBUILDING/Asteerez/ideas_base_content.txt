Have the coins be throwable as weapons, you could make them do different damage or different effects based on what the coins are idc I just think it'd be interesting tf they were throwable

For the customizeable currency you could just rip the code from a banner and a loom and use it in the same way

Make the coins able to be placed and pile up terraria style

Have wells that could give you an effect when you threw a coin in them

Have a coin that has a 50/50 chance of killing you upon flippage, probably made out of 9 other different coins, you could use it as a way to gamble your own life

the flipping system being a simple system where the player could sneak right click with a coin in their hand to hypothetically flip it.

An ATM where you could deposit currency and get it back from other places, like an ender chest for money from this mod

have a shit coin that has no value and can only be thrown. It'd generate randomly on the forest floors and could be a toggleable feature for people who don't want an effective shit post

Coin bags that act like hammers as melee weapons. They'd deal large damage but have slow recharge time

Mint Coin Encyclopedia, in game book that dynamically changes based on what coins you have found before (could also be called the Numismatist's guide to MI-CO)

A village structure that is based off of a bank and could have money bags inside of them full of either near worthless or kind of worth coins in them, also having a banking system which could be interconnected with ATMS and what not

On the idea of the village bank you could have iron golems called "Iron Tellers" which can be used to deposit coins or take them out. And if you'd decide to break in to the bank they would aggro and kill you, there'd be 3 different tellers in one bank

Upon death the tellers could give armor pieces that could be worn to give "money resistance" it'd act like the armor from zelda botw where you'd gain good protection based on how much money you have, and upon getting hit you'd lose some of that money, this would only work with teller coins which can only be obtained by killing tellers, the teller coins can be flipped for a funny message.

For a larger idea. you could have each village have an economic value in which certain coins would be more worth in those villages compared to others.

Another larger idea is you could implement small coin goblin thiefs which spawn randomly around y 30 - 20 which can steal coins from you

You could have a Totem of Solvency which makes you keep money on death, it could be made from special antique golden coins which can be found in ruins such as the aquatic temples or in pots (which you can implement yourself) and 2 emeralds 

Golden coins could be used to trade with piglins in the nether

Antique golden coins can be thrown on the ground in the nether to cause piglin fights

Coins made of turtle shells which can be flipped to either destroy the coin or grant water breathing and keep the coin, they can be found in aquatic temples

Villagers can now carry money upon death (they can carry copper through iron coins)

A rare feature that can spawn into the banks is a stock market that does stock market things

Coins can be placed in skulls as a reference to the tradition of obols which would be placed in peoples mouths when they died to give them "sustenance for the journey" and to seal their protection, it wouldn't actually do anything though it'd just be neat little reference that you can decide to add things to

if you throw a coin on the ground with grass on it and a sheep eats that grass, they on the coin and die voiding the coin and giving you base drops

Contributer coins which can only be found on random drop chance of villagers and have no use other than display

when a coin is placed in an item frame the item frame gets a special texture around it that looks like the coin

Combining copper, iron, gold, nuggets and 3 netherite scrap can grant you the muticoin which can be flipped for a chance to give you the 2 of 1 of those coins otherwise the coin is detroyed

brick coin that can be made with clay and has no value other than to be thrown for more damage that some of the average coin types

A coin trading station which can be used with specifically players to trade items for coins, you could put an item into a chest like gui and then have a square that's dedicated specifically for coins where you can only put coins into them

in jungle ruins you can come across tokens of the jungle which can be flipped for a chance to break the coin or give you night vision

end coins which can only be found in end structures that can be flipped for leviation and can be thrown to give levitation, these can either drop from shulkers or can be found in the chests

Coin display table which can be made out of wood and the carpet of choice, in this display you can place any multiple of 4 up to 64coins on the display and it will show them on the table for no reason other than decoration

Discoin, it's a stupid idea but on flip it will 100% drop the link to Zap's Discord server

Coin template that doesn't exist in game but exists purely for people who want to make mod compats

copper coins can be placed on lightning rods to get charge coins which can be thrown to get lightning strikes

high value coins can be thrown at villagers to inflict both damage and a breeding effect 

bottle caps that come from broken bottles, it's effectively rubber but it's a reference to fallout in the fact that they are bottle cap coins

You can craft a coin on a stick which can be used like a shovel and has no effective purpose other than that

In Woodland mansions you can find "pillagers bounty" which is a room full of money bags that can contain silver coins or iron coins but when the player takes them they get the bad omen debuff

Bed rock coins which can only be obtained by hitting bedrock with a diamond pickaxe for 10 minutes
the coin is unbreakable and has no value whatsoever

A coin printing press system which can be fed materials to mass produce coins and if done in a village it could be used to inflate their economy

Pyramids can have Desert coins which would be gold coins that look like they have specs of sand on them, when flipped the coin can either be destroyed and give the player the mummy's curse debuff which makes the night spawn more enemies and coins lose half their value for 10 minutes, or give them strength 2 and absorption

Coin enchantments, specifically to increase their throw velocity or to make them deal more damage

A curse enchantment called "Curse of bankruptcy" which makes coins lose half their value when wearing the set armor piece
