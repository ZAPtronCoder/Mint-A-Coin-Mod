Have the coins be throwable as weapons, you could make them do different damage or different effects based on what the coins are idc I just think it'd be interesting tf they were throwable

For the customizeable currency you could just rip the code from a banner and a loom and use it in the same way

Make the coins able to be placed and pile up terraria style

Have wells that could give you an effect when you threw a coin in them

Have a coin that has a 50/50 chance of killing you upon flippage, probably made out of 9 other different coins, you could use it as a way to gamble your own life

the flipping system being a simple system where the player could sneak right click with a coin in their hand to hypothetically flip it.

An ATM where you could deposit currency and get it back from other places, like an ender chest for money from this mod

have a shit coin that has no value and can only be thrown. It'd generate randomly on the forest floors and could be a toggleable feature for people who don't want an effective shit post

Coin bags that act like hammers as melee weapons. They'd deal large damage but have slow recharge time

Mint Coin Encyclopedia, in game book that dynamically changes based on what coins you have found before (could also be called the Numismatist's guide to MI-CO)

A village structure that is based off of a bank and could have money bags inside of them full of either near worthless or kind of worth coins in them, also having a banking system which could be interconnected with ATMS and what not

On the idea of the village bank you could have iron golems called "Iron Tellers" which can be used to deposit coins or take them out. And if you'd decide to break in to the bank they would aggro and kill you, there'd be 3 different tellers in one bank

Upon death the tellers could give armor pieces that could be worn to give "money resistance" it'd act like the armor from zelda botw where you'd gain good protection based on how much money you have, and upon getting hit you'd lose some of that money, this would only work with teller coins which can only be obtained by killing tellers, the teller coins can be flipped for a funny message.

For a larger idea. you could have each village have an economic value in which certain coins would be more worth in those villages compared to others.

Another larger idea is you could implement small coin goblin thiefs which spawn randomly around y 30 - 20 which can steal coins from you

You could have a Totem of Solvency which makes you keep money on death, it could be made from special antique golden coins which can be found in ruins such as the aquatic temples or in pots (which you can implement yourself) and 2 emeralds 

Golden coins could be used to trade with piglins in the nether

Antique golden coins can be thrown on the ground in the nether to cause piglin fights

Coins made of turtle shells which can be flipped to either destroy the coin or grant water breathing and keep the coin, they can be found in aquatic temples

Villagers can now carry money upon death (they can carry copper through iron coins)

A rare feature that can spawn into the banks is a stock market that does stock market things

Coins can be placed in skulls as a reference to the tradition of obols which would be placed in peoples mouths when they died to give them "sustenance for the journey" and to seal their protection, it wouldn't actually do anything though it'd just be neat little reference that you can decide to add things to
